# Heawie v1.6.0 - The Power Refinement Update 🚀

This release focuses on absolute visual clarity in Light Mode, significant performance gains, and smarter navigation behavior.

### 🌟 New Features & Enhancements

#### 1. Smart Navigation (New Tab Behavior) 🆕
- **Heartbeat Protection**: All shortcuts (ChatGPT, Prime Video, etc.) and external links clicked from the Heartbeat home page now automatically open in a **New Tab**.
- This ensures your personal Heartbeat space remains open and active while you browse the web.
- Improved link interception to prevent accidental navigation away from the home screen.

#### 2. Ultimate Light Mode Visibility 👁️
- **Forced High Contrast**: Aggressive CSS overrides ensure all text, icons, and buttons are midnight-dark in Light Mode. No more white-on-white text!
- **Solid UI**: Navigation bar and Address bar now have solid, high-contrast backgrounds for a sharp, modern look.
- **Icon Clarity**: Every single SVG icon has been tuned for maximum stroke visibility on light backgrounds.

#### 3. Custom Wallpapers 🖼️
- Added support for local custom wallpapers via the Settings menu.
- Upload any image from your computer; it is saved locally and persists across sessions.
- Perfectly balanced with both Light and Dark modes.

#### 4. Speed & Performance ⚡
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Animated backgrounds now utilize GPU acceleration, making the "breathing" effect silky smooth even on lower-end devices.
- **Webview Caching**: Enabled persistent data partitions for faster site loading—sites you visit frequently will now snap to open almost instantly.
- **Search Optimization**: Refined domain detection regex for the quickest search-to-result transition.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes
- Fixed broken icon slugs for ChatGPT and Prime Video.
- Implemented an automatic logo fallback (Favicon API) to ensure no shortcut ever shows a broken image.
- Synchronized global sound and breathing states across all active tabs.
